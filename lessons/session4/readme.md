## Overview

Now that we have the basics of ```OpenCV``` under our belt, we're able to start doing more sophisticated image (pre-)processing with our image data.

In the code along session today, we'll be seeing how to do some more of the tasks that we covered in the lecture. These tasks are those which primarily rely on using convolutional kernels:

- Blurring
- Thresholding
- Edge detection

So, by the end of today, you'll have learned all of the most important aspects of processing images with ```OpenCV```. Next week we'll start to see how we can use machine learning when working with image data, just like in Language Analytics.

There will be time today to start or to continue working on Assignment 1, which is now available via Github Classrooms and can be accessed [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/BzEQJiKC).
